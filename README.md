# Macroeconomics Exercises for Bachelor Students
Welcome to this repository containing Macroeconomics exercises designed for bachelor-level social-science students. 
The exercises cover various macroeconomic concepts and include both task descriptions (PDF files) and Jupyter notebooks that can be executed in Google Colab for verification and further exploration.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
1) PDF_Exercises: Contain task settings and problem descriptions. Most take-home exercises (files with -xm- in the filename) are designed to generate different numerical values based on each student's unique 8-digit student ID (e.g., 66110028).
2) Jupyter_Exercises: Include Python code to analyze and verify the exercises.

ðŸš€ How to Use
For Assigning Exercises
1) Distribute the PDF tasks to students.
2) In-class exercises: Files with -cl- in the filename.
3) Take-home exercises: Files with -xm- in the filename (these may vary for different student IDs).

For Grading Student Work
1) Download or clone the repository:
2) Open a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab:
3) Click the "Open in Colab" button (if available) or upload the notebook manually to Colab.
4) Run the provided Python code to verify students' solutions and explore macroeconomic concepts interactively.
